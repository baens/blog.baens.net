STOP using semanitc version for your services people! Semantic version is for libaries. Semantic versioning works great for libraries where the API information is important. For services (or even applications), this information starts breaking down. What kind of information is really pertant to end users if you increment your major version? Do I have to keep track of all the breaking UI changes? Do I have to let my user know what happen and how to do previously what they had before? Or are my end users just looking for when was the release date of this piece of software and is there anything newer. 

I think a much better approach will be a simple build or asset number. Something that is human comprehendable. So its a build number that is ever increasing and relays that information to the end user which is the right version to pick.
