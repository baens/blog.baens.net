I want to try out and find a way to get a graphql interface with a postgres database. If possible I would like this to have a kotlin service but that isn't fully required.

Graphiql: https://github.com/graphql/graphiql
This is a browser to review data from the graphql end point

Graphql-java: https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java
This currently appears to be the most generic java implementation that I can find
